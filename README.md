# hng-kiridashi-data

This is a dataset that describes the coordinates and character
information of each glyph-image extracted from some full-text images
published on the Internet using the IIIF API corresponding to the
source of the HNG dataset.

The cropped images were generated on the Web collaboration tool "切り
出しくん (Kiridashi-kun)" which was developed by International
Institute for Digital Humanities.


## Format

Each data file consists of a header and a body.

### Header

The header consists of comment lines starting with #, and consists of
a metadata section and a column description section.

The metadata section is described in the following format:

	#<SPACE><item name><TAB>=<SPACE><value>

Currently, **manifest**, **HNG code** and **HNG source ID** are
defined as <item name>.

- **manifest**: Manifest URI of IIIF Presentation API
- **HNG code**: HNG folder code of the source
- **HNG source ID**: HNG ID of the source

Column description section is the following format:

	# osid	sid	page	ln	cn	x	y	w	h	char	hng-gid	flg	remarks	img	mx	my	canvas

It describes the name of fields.


### Body

The format of body is TSV (tab-separated values).  Each column is as
follows.
